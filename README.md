### About the website

This is a website for a fictional company, 'Tails of Valhalla', offering dog walking and dog training services. It is designed to be easy to navigate across a range of devices, making it easy for new and existing customers to book services easily and smoothly, as well as for prospective customers to find out more about the company and what they offer.

## User Experience (UX) | The 5 Planes

The project planning was based on the five planes of UX design, as described in Jesse James Garrett's book The Elements of User Experience. To assist in the planning process, I referred to an article titled ["UX Design using the Five Planes Method"](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05) by Urooj Qureshi, which provides a detailed breakdown of the concepts outlined in the book. The following five planes served as a guiding framework for the project planning:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### Scope Plane
---
Using the strategy plane as a guide, and the creator/user goals therein, I can see what features are in scope for me to include in the project. One noteable mention I have identified from the user goals, is the inclusion of creating an account to manage bookings. At the time of writing, I do not possess the knowledge of back-end development required to implement this feature and this is therefore not in scope. An alternative feature, that is in scope, will be included in place of this to marginally address this user goal. To address the other creator/user goals, the following features are in scope to be included:

- A clean and minimal home/landing page including the company name and logo.
- A header, including a navigation bar to navigate through the project pages.
- A home page including the following sections/content:
    - "About Us" section including information about the company.
    - "Services" section describing what services the company offers and their respective prices.
    - "Meet the team" section including information the team and their qualifications.
    - "Why us" section outlining what makes the company different/ what they offer during and outside of booked sessions.
    - "Testimonials"/"Reviews" section which include some reviews of customers that have used the company previously.
- A button which directs the user the booking page. This button will be easily identifiable and stand out at all times throughout the project.
- A booking page where the user can send their information, required service, dates and other relevant information.
- A unique and identifiable theme that aligns with the company throughout the project
