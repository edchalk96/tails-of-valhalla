### About the website

This is a website for a fictional company, 'Tails of Valhalla', offering dog walking and dog training services. It is designed to be easy to navigate across a range of devices, making it easy for new and existing customers to book services easily and smoothly, as well as for prospective customers to find out more about the company and what they offer.

## User Experience (UX) | The 5 Planes

The project planning was based on the five planes of UX design, as described in Jesse James Garrett's book The Elements of User Experience. To assist in the planning process, I referred to an article titled ["UX Design using the Five Planes Method"](https://medium.com/designcentered/ux-design-5-planes-method-b1b1d6587c05) by Urooj Qureshi, which provides a detailed breakdown of the concepts outlined in the book. The following five planes served as a guiding framework for the project planning:

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

### Strategy Plane
---

### Scope Plane
---
Using the strategy plane as a guide, and the creator/user goals therein, I can see what features are in scope for me to include in the project. One noteable mention I have identified from the user goals, is the inclusion of creating an account to manage bookings. At the time of writing, I do not possess the knowledge of back-end development required to implement this feature and this is therefore not in scope. An alternative feature, that is in scope, will be included in place of this to marginally address this user goal. To address the other creator/user goals, the following features are in scope to be included:

- A clean and minimal home/landing page including the company name and logo.
- A header, including a navigation bar to navigate through the project pages.
- A home page including the following sections/content:
    - "About Us" section including information about the company and the area the company operates.
    - "Services" section describing what services the company offers and their respective prices.
    - "Meet the team" section including information the team and their qualifications.
    - "Why us" section outlining what makes the company different/ what they offer during and outside of booked sessions.
    - "Testimonials"/"Reviews" section which include some reviews of customers that have used the company previously.
- A button which directs the user the booking page. This button will be easily identifiable and stand out at all times throughout the project.
- A booking page where the user can send their information, required service, dates and other relevant information. Here will also contain a check-box for if the user would like to receive weekly blogs in their inbox, which can also be seen on the blogs page (see below).
- A blogs page which includes blogs written by the company which contain helpful tips as well as any helpful links to aid dog owners in training/walking. This will also contain blogs with updates on the company.
- A unique and identifiable theme that aligns with the company brand throughout the project.
- A consistent footer at the bottom of each page, with the following relevant information:
    - Location of the company including postcode examples in which it operates.
    - The companies social media links.
    - Contact us link where the user are able to send any queries/questions they may have before requesting a booking.
- A Gallery page including images and videos of training and walking sessions.

### Structure Plane
---

The project aims to incorporate a cohesive theme inspired by the company's branding, which draws from Nordic/Norse mythology. With this in mind, inspirartion as well as careful attention will be given to integrating and incorporating these elements throughout the entire project.

### *Design*
#### Colour Scheme
- In keeping with a Nordic theme for this project, I researched Nordic colours leading to the discovery of [this site](https://www.nordtheme.com/), which gives examples of colours inspired by this theme. Out of the colours provided here, 2 were chosen for this project and were used as a base for the rest of the colour palette. As the primary colour is a shade of blue, and in knowing orange is the opposing/contrasting colour, I knew a shade of orange would be needed. Using this, and to narrow down a particular shade of orange whilst being able to visualise the contrast and colour palette as a whole, [this site](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%232E3440&sub=1) was used to generate a colour palette using the primary colour. After this research, the following colours will be used as the colour palette for this project: 

    - #2E3440 (Polar night blue)
    - #5C6270 (Dark shade of cyan blue)
    - #DAA21C (Dark shade of orange)
	- #ECEFF4 (Snow storm white)

#### Typography
- **Norse** and **NorseBold** will be the main font used for headings/titles/sub-titles in this project. This font was downloaded from [this website](https://www.1001fonts.com/norse-font.html#license) before being added to the project files and imported into the CSS file. In keeping with the company brand this font was chosen as it is inspired by the same theme of Norse mythology. For sections of the project that are more text heavy, **Belanosima** (imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Belanosima#styles)) will be used so the text is easier to read for the user. The fallback font will be sans-serif in the instance these fonts are not imported into the project correctly.  

#### Imagery & Icons
- Icons will be used for the social media links in the footer of the project through all pages. These will be given a hover feature to give feedback to the user.
- In keeping with the company theme, runic characters, obtained via [this W3 schools site](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_runic.asp), will be used in place of bullet points for unordered lists.
- The hero image presented to the user on the landing page of the project is important as it will be used to grab the users attention whilst also keeping with the company brand. The image chosen therefore shows a person and their dog win the foreground with mountains in the background.
- Other images within the project, including that in the Gallery, will be of dogs during training and/or walking with their owners/trainers.
- All images and content within the project with device responsive and therefore will scale accrodign the pixel width of the device.

### Skeleton Plane

### *Wireframes*
Below are the wireframes for all pages created for the project using Balsamiq. These wireframes are initial concepts forhow the project will be structured across different devices.

- #### Home Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/home-page.pdf)
- #### Book Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/book-page.pdf)
- #### Gallery Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/gallery-page.pdf)
- #### Blogs Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/blogs-page.pdf)
- #### Contact Us Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/contact-us-page.pdf)
- #### Example Blog Page - [View](https://github.com/edchalk96/tails-of-valhalla/blob/main/documentation/wireframes/example-blog-page.pdf)

As these wire frames were an initial conceptualisation of the project, some aspects were required to be altered during development. The below list are differences seen between the wireframe and project:
 - Did not include the down scroll button on the home page as this made the home page look cluttered.
 - Images are not overlapped with coloured section blocks and are instead kept seperate for a cleaer look and feel.
 - Terms and conditions modal included in the Book page which was not included in the wire frames.
 - Text at the top of the Gallery page was not included as this did not provide any useful information and was deemed not needed.
 - Minor realignment of the different label and input boxes in the contact us page.

 ### Surface Plane
 ---

### *Features*

#### *Navbar* 
The navbar remains the same across all pages and is responsive and changes to a hamburger menu at 992 pixels. Once clicked the navbar items overlay the current pages content with a translucent white background to make them stand out. The logo in the centre of the navabr is a link back to the home page. The current active page is indicated in the navbar by being underlined and orange (#DAA21C) or underlined and white (#ECEFF4) when the hamburger icon is toggled.

#### *Footer*
The footer remains the same across all pages and contains information about the company. Contact information is included as informaiton and the sub-heading for this information is a link to the Contact Us page for to make this easier for the user to make contact. Links are also included to the companies social media pages, contained within the respective social meida platforms icon.

#### *Hero Image & Images*
The hero image was selected to fit within the theme of the company and contains a dark overlay so the company logo and book button stand out against the image. All other images used were also chosen as they are relatable to the company and the section they are within on the website.

#### *Logo*
The company logo, used in the navbar, was created by myself (author of website) by outlining an existing image taken by myself and filling this in with the colour pallete of the company/website.

### Further Testing
- The website was tested on the following browsers with success: 
    - Google Chrome
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Mozilla Firefox
    - Opera
    - Safari
- The webiste was tested throughout using chrome developer tools especially to test the responsiveness of the site, using emulators and generic screen sizes (based on pixels) with success.
- Constructive feedack and bug testing was received from friends/colleagues/relatives who were asked to review the site.
- Lighthouse, a feature of Google Chrome developer tools was used to assess the performance of the website, it's features and where approproiate, analyse what improvememts could be made to improve the sites performance. Each page of the site was tested with a few amendments being made as a result, as showm below:

1. **Home page**

![Lighthouse testing output from the sites home page](assets/images/lighthouse-test-home.png) 
![Lighthouse testing, analysis on home page](assets/images/lighthouse-test-home-analysis.png) 
![Lighthouse testing, further analysis on home page](assets/images/lighthouse-test-home-analysis2.png) 
![Lighthouse testing, further analysis on home page](assets/images/lighthouse-test-home-analysis3.png)

- As can be seen by the above images the performance parameter of the home page needed improvement. By looking depper into this and the analysis sections of the lighthous report, it could be seen that the image files associated with the home page were too large and needed compressing.
    - After the above amendment of compressing the image files, the performance paramter of the lighthouse report has improved, as can be seen below.

2. **Book page**

![Lighthouse testing output from the sites book page](assets/images/lighthouse-test-book.png)

- As can be seen by the above image, all parameters tested are performing well for this page (all 90+/green) and therefore no amendments for this page were deemed necessary.

3. **Gallery page**

### Known Bugs and Fixes
- At exactly 992 pixels, when the navbar transitions from a full navbar to a hamburger menu, the navbar gets pushed below the header and in the CSS style of the hamburger menu items. No fix found for this as of yet so this is still to be fixed at a later date.
- During W3C validator testing a warning was flagged up ([see here](assets/images/w3c-validator-warning.png)) with the following message: "The document is not mappable to XML 1.0 due to two consecutive hyphens in a comment.". This is used in the comments when dividing the ocde into sections. In order to fix/remove this warning message, `<!------` was changed to `<!-- ===`, and in doing so the same structure of the sectioning remained. Credit to Harry Leepz's [Skihism Project Read.me file](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/Sikhism-Project/blob/master/README.md) for for this fix.
- During W3C validator testing of the index.html page, an error regarding the navbar logo image ([see here](assets/images/w3c-validator-navbar-logo-error.png)) was picked up with the following message: "Bad value 50px for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw p instead." In order to fix this, "px" was removed from the code leaving the following code `width="50"`. This fix was implemented across all pages as the navbar is ever-present on the site.
- During W3C validator testing of the index.html page, an error flagged up for an duplicated ID of `id="accordionExample"` in the *Our Services* section ([see here](assets/images/w3c-validator-duplicate-id.png)). This was fixed by renaming the first instance this ID appears to `id="accordionDogWalking"`.
- During W3C validator testing of the index.html page, an error flagged up ([see here](assets/images/w3c-validator-button-p-error.png)) with the following message: "Element p not allowed as child of element button in this context. (Suppressing  further errors from this subtree.)". This was fixed by removing the paragraph element from the code, as well as the ID and respective CSS styling code.
- During W3C validator testing of the index.html page, an error flagged up ([see here](assets/images/w3c-validator-aria-controls-error.png)) with the following message: "The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.". This was fixed by updating the aria-contols code from `aria-controls="navbarTogglerDemo01"` to `aria-controls="navbar-content"`.
